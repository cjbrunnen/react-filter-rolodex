# React filter rolodex

This app was built with a focus on architecture, state positioning and resability of components.

The `SearchBox` component is completely generic, with the state being hoisted and bound, using an arrow function in `App.js`.

Although I'm a fan of React Hooks, I'm using class-based components and lifecycle methods here for practice.
